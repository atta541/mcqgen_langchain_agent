As a field of research in computer science focusing on the automation of intelligent behavior through machine learning, it develops and studies methods and software which enable machines to perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals, with the aim of performing tasks typically associated with human intelligence. Such machines may be called AIs.\n",

Some high-profile applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go).[1] However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"[2][3]\n",

For other uses, see AI (disambiguation), Artificial intelligence (disambiguation), and Intelligent agent.\\nPart of a series on\\nArtificial intelligence\\n\\nMajor goals\\nApproaches\\nApplications\\nPhilosophy\\nHistory\\nGlossary\\nvte\\nArtificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems, as opposed to the natural intelligence of living beings. As a field of research in computer science focusing on the automation of intelligent behavior through machine learning, it develops and studies methods and software which enable machines to perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals, with the aim of performing tasks typically associated with human intelligence. Such machines may be called AIs.\\n\\nAI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go).[1] However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"[2][3]\\n\\nAlan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine intelligence.[4] Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.[5] The field went through multiple cycles of optimism,[6][7] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter.[8][9] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques,[10] and after 2017 with the transformer architecture.[11] This led to the AI boom of the early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence.[12]',\n",
